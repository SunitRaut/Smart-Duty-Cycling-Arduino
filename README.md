# Smart-Duty-Cycling-Arduino

Smart Duty Cycling Library for Arduino. This library keeps ON/OFF timings for your MCU in background so you can perform your tasks without worrying about duty cycling. 

# Features: 

- Generate Duty Cycle with Frequency and Duty Cycle as inputs

- Alternatively, generate duty cycle with custom wake and sleep periods

- Non-blocking Duty cycle generation. Perform other operations in your code without being blocked by library operations. 

- You can synchronize two or more MCUs to go into Sleep/Wake period at the same time. 

# Applications: 

This library can be used for following applicaions: 

- PWM Generation using Digital Pins

- Sleep-Wake Cycles for Power Saving in Wireless Devices and other embedded systems

- Any Application that operates in periodic ON/OFF, Active/Inactive, Wake/Sleep Periods.
